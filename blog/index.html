     <p>I have often said that I believe computer programming should be adopted as a core curriculum subject in primary school, just like science, history, or math.  I often give presentations to this effect for parents, teachers, and school administrators.  In this article, I&rsquo;ll explore a few of the reasons why I believe so strongly in the power of early CS education.</p>

<p>When considering the place of computer science in the curriculum, let&rsquo;s first look at why we teach other core subjects.</p>

<p>We teach science because we want children to understand the world around them, and the scientific method is a fantastic intellectual tool for investigating the world around you. In a modern society, where scientific advancements directly affect so many aspects of our lives, it is advantageous to have a good understanding of how science works.</p>

<p>In the same way, learning about history or math contribute to a better understanding of the world by providing perspectives and ways of thinking that we wouldn&rsquo;t otherwise know.  In particular, I&rsquo;ll talk about the use of math in more detail below.

        Common Struggles

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Tue, Oct 13, 2015</span>

     <p>Over the past few years, I&rsquo;ve taught hundreds of kids to code using Python in workshops, after school programs, and as part of school curriculum.  Most of the students I teach are around middle school age (11-14).  I find this age to be a great time to start learning.  The kids are very engaged and capable - and very motivated to learn, if given the chance.</p>

<p>I prefer Python for teaching kids for a <a href="http://kidscancode.org/blog/2015/09/whypython/">number of reasons</a>, foremost because it&rsquo;s a very beginner-friendly language.  That said, however, there are still a number of very common areas where kids tend to struggle the most.</p>

     <p>Making games is a great way to improve your programming skills while making something fun at the same time.  Pygame is a set of tools for Python that make it easy to work with graphics and sound.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, installing Pygame is not as easy as using it is.  Below you&rsquo;ll find the best directions we&rsquo;ve found for getting it working on your system.  Follow the directions below, and let us know in the comments below if you have any problems.

        Why Python?
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">Thu, Sep 24, 2015</span>

     <p>There are a huge number of programming languages out there.  You&rsquo;ve probably heard of one or two, even if you&rsquo;re not a programmer yourself - Java, C++, Swift, etc.  But what are they all about and how do you choose which one to learn?</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s really not one perfect answer to this question, but personally, I prefer Python for teaching kids for a number of reasons.  I&rsquo;ll go into some of those reasons below, but if I had to boil it down to a few bullet points, they would be these:</p>

<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s great for beginners</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s not a &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; language</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s very widely used</li>
</ul>

    <span class="post-date">Sun, Aug 23, 2015</span>

     &ldquo;Gamification&rdquo; is the application of game design and gaming mechanics in non-gaming contexts. When you see LinkedIn giving you a &ldquo;profile score,&rdquo; that&rsquo;s gamification at work. Done well, it can be a great method of incentivizing users to be more active. In fact, in the absence of formal gamification features, users will often &ldquo;gamify&rdquo; things themselves - from people on Facebook who try and get more Likes than their friends, to drivers trying to time it so they don&rsquo;t hit any red lights.
